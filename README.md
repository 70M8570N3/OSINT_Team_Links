# Original
This list was originaly taken from https://github.com/jivoi/awesome-osint and converted into html for easy import. This list had a great deal of links to commercial software and hasn't been updated in some time. Too many links didn't have any actionable OSINT value and have been removed. All thanks go to jivio for the original but this version will be going in different direction from the original.

# To-Do
Continue to remove any links to paid software or services.
Remove any dead links found.
